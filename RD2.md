What challenges did you encounter?
How did you follow the first 3 rules of programming?
Did you overcome them, and how?
Any key takeaways?
Do you think you learned what you were supposed to learn for this lab?
What was it like working with your partner?


In this lab we were supposed to learn how to work with files, reading and writing them, working with functions, and
working with tables (lists of lists). To solve the problem we first focused on the major tasks we needed to complete
for the lab and then after that broke each one down into functions, and wrote the algorithm. The key concepts we 
explored were how to open files, read and write files, and output the minimum profit out of all the movies listed. We 
tried testing various and extreme cases to make sure our error checking was correct and the program did not crash. At 
first one of the challenges we encountered was what the functions were going to be, but after working with other groups
and as a class we were able to accomplish our tasks. We followed the first three rules of programming planning out how 
we would tackle the lab, writing a human-readable essay for our algorithm, and then practicing our code to guarantee it 
works properly. I'm not sure, I learned completely what I was supposed to from this lab because I've had lots of other 
assignments to worry about this week, but I was able to learn more about files and how to write and read them. Working
with Andrew went very well, we communicated and were able to complete the lab efficiently.
